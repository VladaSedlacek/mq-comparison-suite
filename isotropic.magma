// Given a quadratic form F in an arbitrary number of variables, Mark Watkins (Bristol)
// has used Denis Simonâ€™s ideas as the basis of an algorithm he has implemented in Magma
// for finding a large (totally) isotropic subspace of F .

// The algorithm used is due to Simon (see [Sim05]), and uses on the Bosma-
// Stevenhagen algorithm for the 2-part of the class groups of a quadratic field
// (see [BS96]). There is no corresponding intrinsic for a lattice: since the associated
// form is definite, there are no isotropic vectors
